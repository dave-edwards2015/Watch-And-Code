# Watch-And-Code

I have had many issues and errors try to push these files upto github


$ git push origin master
To github.com:dave-edwards2015/Watch-And-Code.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:dave-edwards2015/Watch-And-Code.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

I had to then force the upload with these commands

git push --force origin master
